# Projet-2-OC

Implementation of projet 2 from Openclassrooms
Implementation of responsive website (Only with HTML5 and CSS3), based on provided instructions and a digital mock-up.

The objectif was to create a new website for Booki agency. A website where we can find the better accommodation for holidays and some of the best closer activities. The user can select his needs via the available filters.

There are no back-end for this project, so, all links are useless.

Code composition :
- Htlm code in the file 'index.html'
- Images are in the folder 'images'
- CSS code is divided in 5 parts (css files) in the folder 'css' : 
    - Style (for general option)
    - Header
    - Section1
    - Section2
    - Footer
  In each css file, there are the desktop version, the tablet version, and the device version.
